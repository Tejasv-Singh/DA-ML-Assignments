# 🎮 Assignment 1: The Master Guessing Game

Welcome to the "Gold Standard" solution for Assignment 1! This version incorporates the best features observed from everyone's submissions, creating a robust and fun guessing game.

## 🌟 Key Features

This implementation includes:

*   **✅ Input Validation**: No more crashes! The game checks if you entered a number and asks you to try again if you didn't.
*   **✅ Smart Looping**: Typos and invalid inputs don't burn your lives. You still get your 3 tries if you slip up typing.
*   **✅ Replayability**: Finished a game? You can choose to play again immediately without restarting the program.
*   **✅ Hints**: The game guides you with "Too high!" or "Too low!" hints to help you narrow down the secret number.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the game using:

```bash
python master_solution.py
```

## 📜 The Challenge

The original assignment was to build a simple guessing game:
1.  Computer picks a number (e.g., 7).
2.  User guesses the number.
3.  Win if correct, lose if wrong (bonus: 3 attempts).

This solution takes it to the next level! Study the code to see how loops, conditionals, and input handling work together to create a smooth user experience.

Happy Coding! 👊✨
